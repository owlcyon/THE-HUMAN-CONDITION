# Emergent: The Frontier

> *"Not all who wander are lost." — Tolkien*  
> *"Not all patterns fit existing categories." — This work*

## What This Folder Is

**Emergent** is where **new patterns, unclassified observations, and anomalies** live before they're fully understood.

This is the **frontier**—the edge of the map where you've noticed something significant but don't yet know:
- What to call it
- Where it fits
- How it connects to existing archetypes

**Emergent patterns are pre-archetypes.** They're raw, unrefined, but real.

---

## Why This Folder Exists

### The Problem:
If you only document patterns that fit existing categories, you'll **miss new discoveries**.

You'll force observations into pre-existing boxes, distorting them to fit rather than letting them reveal something new.

### The Solution:
A dedicated space for **"I don't know what this is yet, but it matters."**

This folder gives you permission to:
- Document patterns before naming them
- Notice contradictions without resolving them
- Ask questions without answering them
- Sit with confusion instead of forcing clarity

---

## What Goes Here

### Unnamed Patterns:
You keep seeing something recur, but it doesn't match any archetype yet.

**Example:**  
*"There's a pattern where people sabotage themselves right before success. Not Addict's Dilemma (no substance). Not Son's Burden (no guilt). Something else. Needs investigation."*

### Anomalies:
Something that breaks the expected pattern. Doesn't fit the archetype. Contradiction.

**Example:**  
*"Met someone in Wounded Hermit mode who isn't isolating from trauma—they're isolating to CREATE. Different motivation. Different outcome. What is this?"*

### Edge Cases:
Observations that are too specific, too strange, or too context-dependent to generalize yet.

**Example:**  
*"Why do some people become MORE social after trauma while others retreat? What's the deciding factor?"*
