# Archetypes

Welcome to the **Archetypes** domain — the foundation of the Human Condition project.

## What This Folder Is

Archetypes are **recurring patterns of human behavior, psychology, and existential tension**.  
They describe roles we inhabit, challenges we face, and the transformations we undergo.

This folder contains:
- Overviews of each archetype
- Individual Markdown files detailing the traits, dynamics, and examples of each
- A template for creating new archetypes

## How to Navigate

Start with the `README.md` overview of core patterns.  
Then explore individual archetypes, for example:
- `the-wounded-hermit.md`  
- `the-trapped-sovereign.md`  

Each archetype file follows the same format for consistency and clarity.

> Archetypes are the lens through which we understand recurring human stories.
