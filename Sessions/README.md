## What This Folder Is

**Sessions** contains the **original conversations**—the raw dialogues, explorations, and excavations that gave rise to the patterns documented elsewhere in this repository.

These are:
- Conversations with AI (Claude, GPT, etc.) where patterns were discovered
- Dialogues with people where insights emerged
- Internal dialogues (stream-of-consciousness writing, self-interrogation)

**Sessions are the unedited source material.** Everything else in the repository is refined, structured, and organized. This folder preserves the **messy, nonlinear, exploratory process** that led to clarity.

## Why Sessions Matter

### 1. **Shows the Process**
Insight doesn't arrive fully formed. It emerges through questions, confusion, iteration. Sessions show this

### 2. **Preserves Context**
 When you read an archetype entry, you see the result. When you read the session that produced it, you see *why* it was framed that way.

### 3. **Enables Re-Mining**
You might skim past something important in a conversation. Later, reading it again, you see what you missed. Sessions let you return to the source.

### 4. **Documents Evolution** Early sessions show early thinking. Later sessions show refinement. You can trace how understanding developed.

### 5. **Transparency**
Showing your raw thinking builds trust. "Here's how I got here" is more credible than "here's the truth."
