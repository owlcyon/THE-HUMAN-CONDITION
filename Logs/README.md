# Logs

This folder documents **daily observations, reflections, and pattern recognition** — the raw material of this project.

## What This Folder Is

Logs are **living records of human experience**.  
They capture the details of lived reality, the small patterns, and the events that inform archetypes and maps.

## Structure

- Organized by year/month/day, e.g., `2025/11-november/2025-11-17.md`
- Each file contains reflections, observations, or insights from that day
- Use logs to trace recurring patterns or explore emergent themes

## How to Read

Start with the most recent log for current context, or explore older entries to see the evolution of observations.
