# Emergent

This folder contains **new, uncategorized patterns and anomalies**—things that don’t yet fit existing categories.

## Purpose

Emergent patterns are:
- Observations or behaviors that resist easy classification
- Early signals of future archetypes or dynamics
- Experimental insights

## How to Use

- Document new patterns as separate Markdown files (e.g., `unnamed-pattern-001.md`)
- Update or move patterns to Archetypes or Catalogs as clarity emerges
- Consider this the frontier space of the project
