# Maps

This folder visualizes the **interconnections between patterns, archetypes, and human dynamics**.

## Purpose

Maps show:
- How archetypes relate to each other
- Feedback loops and reinforcement patterns
- Dynamics of transformation and constraint

## Contents

- Markdown files explaining conceptual connections
- Visual diagrams stored in `/diagrams/` (SVGs, PNGs)
- Cross-references to archetypes and logs

## How to Use

Read the conceptual Markdown maps first, then explore diagrams to see the system visually.
