# Catalogs

This folder archives **examples, historical figures, and case studies** illustrating patterns and archetypes.

## Purpose

Patterns are best understood through real-world instances.  
Catalogs collect:
- Biographies
- Historical events
- Literature and cultural examples
- Contemporary observations

## Structure

- Individual Markdown files for patterns, e.g., `poverty.md` or `transformation.md`
- Subfolders for historical figures or complex examples, e.g., `/historical-figures/`

## How to Navigate

Start with `README.md` to understand the catalog methodology, then explore examples of interest.
