been noticing how every time i open twitter, i feel the pull to react, scroll, consume. not choosing it—being pulled. realized it wasnt individual weakness, was structural. the whole system is designed to fragment attention and extract value from the fragments. started mapping the feedback loops. called it the Distraction-Extraction Supercycle. this is bigger than archetypes—this is the system that makes the archetypes necessary.
