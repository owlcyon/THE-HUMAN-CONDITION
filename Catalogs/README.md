# Catalogs: The Evidence Base

## What Catalogs Are

**Catalogs** are collections of **real examples** where archetypes, patterns, and themes show up in observable reality.

While `/Archetypes/` defines patterns abstractly and `/Logs/` documents personal observations, **Catalogs** provide:
- Historical figures embodying patterns
- Literary characters illustrating archetypes
- Cultural phenomena showing themes
- Contemporary examples from lived experience

**Catalogs ground the work in evidence.** They prove the patterns aren't invented—they're discovered.

## Why Catalogs Matter

### 1. **Validation Through Recurrence**
One example could be coincidence. Five examples across centuries and cultures? That's a pattern.

### 2. **Concrete Over Abstract**
"The Wounded Hermit" is abstract. "Nietzsche in Sils-Maria" is concrete. Examples make theory tangible.

### 3. **Learning Through Comparison**
When you see the same archetype in different contexts, you understand what's *essential* (shows up everywhere) vs. *contextual* (specific to situation).

### 4. **Practical Application**
Seeing how someone else navigated a pattern helps you navigate it yourself.

### 5. **Expanding Awareness**
Catalogs help you recognize patterns in real time. Once you've seen The Trapped Sovereign in Marcus Aurelius, you'll notice it in your neighbor.

## Types of Catalogs

### 1. **Thematic Catalogs**
Collections organized by theme (poverty, transformation, guilt, sovereignty).

**Example files:**
- `poverty.md` — How poverty constrains across contexts
- `transformation.md` — Examples of successful and failed transformations
- `guilt.md` — The many faces of guilt (son's burden, survivor's guilt, existential guilt)

### 2. **Archetype Catalogs**
Collections organized by archetype (all examples of Wounded Hermit, all examples of Trapped Sovereign).

**Example files:**
- `wounded-hermit-examples.md`
- `trapped-sovereign-examples.md`

*(These link back to archetype files in `/Archetypes/` for cross-referencing)*

### 3. **Domain-Specific Catalogs**
Collections from specific sources (history, literature, film, contemporary life).

**Example folders:**
- `/Catalogs/historical-figures/` — Real people across time
- `/Catalogs/literature/` — Characters from novels, plays, poetry
- `/Catalogs/film-tv/` — Characters from visual media
- `/Catalogs/contemporary/` — People alive today, events happening now

## How Catalog Entries Work

Each catalog entry includes:

### Basic Structure:
```markdown
## [Name / Title]

**Context:** [Who/what/when/where]

**Archetype(s):** [Primary pattern(s) embodied]

**Key Characteristics:**
- [Observable trait 1]
- [Observable trait 2]
- [Observable trait 3]

**Example:**
[Specific instance demonstrating the pattern]

**Outcome:**
[How it resolved—success, failure, ongoing]

**Lessons:**
[What this example teaches about the pattern]

**Sources:**
[Where you observed this—book, film, personal knowledge, etc.]
```

---

## Current Catalogs (Work in Progress)

### Thematic:
- **poverty.md** — Material constraint across contexts
- **transformation.md** — Change processes (successful and failed)
- **isolation.md** — Hermit patterns across cultures
- **sovereignty.md** — Agency under constraint

### Archetype-Specific:
- **wounded-hermit-examples.md**
- **trapped-sovereign-examples.md**

### Domain-Specific:
- **/historical-figures/** — Marcus Aurelius, Nietzsche, Malcolm X, etc.
- **/literature/** — Siddhartha, Hamlet, Raskolnikov, etc.
- **/film-tv/** — (To be populated)
- **/contemporary/** — (To be populated—requires discretion)

## How to Use Catalogs

**When learning an archetype:**
Go to the catalog. Read 3-5 examples. See how the pattern shows up differently in different contexts.

**When stuck in a pattern:**
Find examples of others in that pattern. How did they navigate it? What worked? What didn't?

**When analyzing someone:**
Search catalogs for similar figures. Does their trajectory match a known pattern?

**When teaching/sharing:**
Use catalog entries as teaching tools. Concrete examples communicate better than abstract theory.

## Contributing to Catalogs

### Guidelines for Adding Entries:

**1. Grounded in Observation**
You must have directly observed the example (read the book, watched the film, studied the history, lived it yourself).

**2. Specific, Not General**
"Nietzsche in Sils-Maria, 1881-1888" is specific. "Philosophers who were alone" is too vague.

**3. Pattern-Focused**
Explain *why* this is an example of the archetype. What specific traits make it fit?

**4. Respectful**
When cataloging living people or people you know personally, use discretion. Change names if needed. Focus on pattern, not gossip.

**5. Cited**
Always include sources. If it's personal observation, say so. If it's from a book, cite it.

---

## Special Considerations

### Historical Figures:
We have records but not full internal access. Focus on documented behaviors, writings, outcomes.

### Literary Characters:
They're fictional but reveal truths about human patterns. Analyze as you would real people.

### Living People / People You Know:
- **Public figures:** Fair game if based on public information
- **Private individuals:** Use pseudonyms or composites to protect privacy
- **Yourself:** Your own experience is always valid to catalog

### Cultural Phenomena:
Patterns show up in movements, traditions, collective behaviors. These can be cataloged too (e.g., "The American Dream as Trapped Sovereign archetype").

---

## Key Principles

### 1. Patterns Transcend Context
The same archetype appears in ancient Rome and modern Chicago. Context changes; structure persists.

### 2. No Example Is Perfect
Real people are messy. They embody multiple archetypes, shift between patterns, contain contradictions. That's okay—catalog what's most dominant or relevant.

### 3. Catalogs Evolve
As your understanding deepens, you'll see patterns you missed the first time. Revisit entries. Update them.

### 4. Quality Over Quantity
Ten well-analyzed examples beat fifty shallow ones. Go deep.

### 5. Diversity Matters
Seek examples across:
- Time periods (ancient, medieval, modern, contemporary)
- Cultures (Western, Eastern, African, Indigenous, etc.)
- Genders, races, classes (patterns show up everywhere; representation matters)
- Domains (history, literature, personal, cultural)

## How Catalogs Feed the System

Catalogs aren't isolated collections. They connect to everything:

- **Archetypes** link to catalogs for evidence
- **Logs** reference catalogs when you notice patterns
- **Maps** use catalog examples to illustrate dynamics
- **Meta-reflections** draw on catalogs for insight

**Catalogs are the proof that this work is real.**

## Examples to Get Started

### Historical Figures:
- **Marcus Aurelius** (Trapped Sovereign—emperor with no freedom)
- **Nietzsche** (Wounded Hermit—Sils-Maria isolation)
- **Malcolm X** (Man Becoming Himself—prison transformation)

### Literature:
- **Siddhartha** (Wounded Hermit → Enlightenment)
- **Hamlet** (Son's Burden—paralyzed by father's ghost)
- **Raskolnikov** (*Crime and Punishment*—Trapped Sovereign turned desperate)

### Film/TV:
- **Walter White** (*Breaking Bad*—Man Becoming Himself, but into villain)
- **Tony Soprano** (*The Sopranos*—Son's Burden with mob patriarch)

### Contemporary:
- Your own life (most important catalog)
- People you know (with discretion)
- Public figures (based on public info)
